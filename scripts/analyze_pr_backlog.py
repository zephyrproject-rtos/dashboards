"""Analyze pull request backlog in the Zephyr GitHub repository.

For every open PR created at least --age days ago the script collects
a set of signals, computes the time since the last *meaningful* activity
(commit pushed, review submitted, or human comment — not label/CI/bot
updates), and classifies each PR into one or more backlog categories.
All findings are written to a self-contained HTML report.

What counts as "meaningful activity"
-------------------------------------
- A commit pushed to the PR branch
- A review submitted (approval, changes-requested, or reviewer comment)
- An issue-level or inline review comment left by a human

What is intentionally excluded
-------------------------------
- Label additions / removals
- Assignee changes
- CI re-runs and status updates
- Cross-references from other issues / PRs
- Any other metadata-only operation that bumps ``updated_at``

Signals collected per PR
------------------------
- Age (days since opened) and meaningful-idle time
- Size (additions + deletions, files changed, commits)
- Number of reviewers requested
- Assignment status (assignee present / absent)
- CI/check-run status (pass / fail / pending) with failing check names
- Comment and discussion activity
- Areas covered by the change (via MAINTAINERS.yml + get_maintainer.py)
- Whether the submitter is a maintainer of any touched area
- Review state breakdown: approvals, changes-requested, commented, dismissed
- Zephyr 2-approval rule coverage (2 approvals required, one from assignee)
